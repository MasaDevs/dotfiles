# neovim
neovim config files are localted in ".config/nvim" folder.

If you'd never used neovim in your currently working pc, it might occur some problem.

If your neovim doesn't show the icon correctry, you might miss the font that can be used.
Make sure your font type if it works for nvim. if doesn't, you should install any kinds of font type than can suit for neovim.
I think "Nerd font" is good choice.
